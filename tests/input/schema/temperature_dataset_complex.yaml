        # with the main differences being

        data: temperatures_in_K

        # The 3 dimensions of the array attribute "temperatures_in_K" are named
        # "x", "y", and "t" in the DataArray. These dims do not need to be the same as the
        # dimensions of the array attribute. A name must be provided for each dimension
        # of the data array.
        dims: ["x", "y", "t"]  # NOTE: y without quotes is parsed as True in YAML 1.1

        # An array attribute within this class that is not the data array above may
        # serve as a coordinate for a set of dimensions in the data array.
        # In most cases, a 1D array is a coordinate for a single dimension in the
        # data array, but it is possible to have an N-dimensional array that is a
        # coordinate for N dimensions in the data array. The format is:
        # <name of array attribute>: <list of dimension names from dims>
        # The number of dimensions of a coordinate must equal the length of the
        # list specified here.
        coords:
          # Here, the latitude for the temperature value at index (i,j,k) is equal to
          # latitude_in_deg[i,j]. Similarly, the longitude for the temperature value at
          # index (i,j,k) is equal to longitude_in_deg[i,j]. The date for the temperature
          # value at index (i,j,k) is equal to date_in_d[k]. The days_with_rain for the
          # temperature value at index (i,j,k) is equal to days_with_rain[k].
